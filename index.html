            <h3> What is a case manager?<a name="casemanager"></a></h3>
                <p>To start with the life of a foster child you need to first understand what is means to be a Foster Care Case Manager
            You might ask,&ldquo;What is case managing?&rdquo; Case managing consist typically of some type of demographic that you are doing front line work in order to help or aid someone through a situation where that be for a short or long term.  I have worked with Domestic violence victims, Homeless teenagers,  mentally ill homeless singles and families, teenage girls and now foster care.  All of these groups have something in common. They are all demographic that has lacked a way to advocate for themselves.  In these situations you have the people not feeling heard and their counterparts(parents,courts and etc) not feeling as though the ones in need are effectively hearing them.

             <p>At that time, there are two ways a child can be brought into care:
             </p>   
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        <li>There was a hotline (someone connect to the childâ€™s life contacts the state of Missouri and let them know the concern. If the concern is great enough a Protective Custody Assessment(PCA) is completed.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <p>
                            <li> A PCA is a form where all pertinent information is written down( as factual as possible) and submitted at Family Court. 
                            </li>

                    <p>
                        <li>Another possibility is that the police come across a situation that causes them to feel as thought the children are an immediate danger the police can file a 33 which allows the children to immediately come into to care.

            </h3>
	            <p> An appropriate home(foster,relative or kinship) is located where the child can go to while more information is gathered. Once the child is in that home the adult has 72  hours to have the child seen by a physician to determine if there are any health issues which could include bruises,broken bones and etc. that can be indicative of physical abuse. During this time the case is assigned to a Foster Care Case Manager. 
                    Within 72 business hours the matter is brought before a Commissioner or Judge as a Protective Custody Hearing(PC). At this hearing, is it determined if the reasons why the are brought into care child(ren) brought into care are still present. If they are not then the child(ren )are allowed to return home. If those concerns are still valid then the child(ren) will remain in care .  During this hearing the child(ren) is appointed  an attorney as well as the parents can apply for a free attorney( determined by their monthly income and family size).

                            <li>The dispostion is when the <a href="#casemanager">case manager</a> would testify as to what has occured since the child(ren)has come into care to the date of the Adjudication.

            <a name="part5">Continous</a>
        </h3>
         <p>After the disposition, court is held every 3-6 months to determine if the same issues that brought the child(ren) into care are still present. Depending on the concerns and resolve of the parents directly correlate with  the length of the case.  Eventually, if a case continues on without hope of reunifying it is then determine if there is another permanent option (adoption or guardianship) that would be in the best interest of the children. Cases can last for 6  months to years upon years.
        There are numerous providers that give their professional opinions but, it the final decesion on everything is up to the Judge or Commissioner. <p>
